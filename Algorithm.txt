1. Make pins connected to driver IC as output.
	Make pins RD0 & RD1 for Left Motor as output.
	Make pins RD2 & RD2 for Right Motor as output.
2. Output zeros to all pins connected to driver IC (RD0, RD1, RD2 & RD3) to turn off both left & right motors initially.
3. Initialize UART module at 9600 baud rate & wait for UART module to stabilize.
4. If UART module is ready, read the received data.
5. If received data is not 'S', go to Step 4.
6. If UART module is ready, read the received data.
7. If received data is not 'X', store the received data in an array and go to Step 6.
8. Access element in the array.
9. If the element is 'f', turn on pins corresponding to forward motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17. 
10. If the element is 'r', turn on pins corresponding to left motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17. 
11. If the element is 'l', turn on pins corresponding to right motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17. 
12. If the element is 'a', turn on pins corresponding to reverse motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17. 
13. If the element is 'b', turn on pins corresponding to 45 degree right motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17. 
14. If the element is 'c', turn on pins corresponding to 135 degree right motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17.  
15. If the element is 'b', turn on pins corresponding to 45 degree left motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17. 
16. If the element is 'c', turn on pins corresponding to 135 degree left motion for a predetermined time and go to Step 17. 
17. If all elements are accessed go to Step 4 else go to Step 8.
